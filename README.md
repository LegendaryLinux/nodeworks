# nodeworks #
*A web server and templating system designed in Node.js*

### Why? ###
Nodeworks started as a foray into learning how to use Node and accidentally became a web server.

### Is it stable? ###
Probably not. It's only been tested a little, and there are many improvements that still need to be made.

### Is it functional? ###
Yes. You can put any typical web files in the appropriate folder, and it will deliver them to the requestor. Templating is also fully functional.

### How do I use this? ###
Further documentation is forthcoming. Sorry, this is still in development.
